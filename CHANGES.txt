CM3020 AI COURSEWORK PART B - CODE MODIFICATIONS LOG
================================================================================

This document logs all modifications made to address the PDF Part B requirement:
"get as high as possible up the mountain, without cheating and flying into the air"

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS APPROACHES (Did Not Work)
================================================================================

We initially attempted to evolve creatures from completely RANDOM starting
genomes. Despite many iterations and parameter adjustments, this approach
consistently failed:

ATTEMPTS MADE:
1. Adjusted fitness function weights (progress, height, movement bonuses)
2. Added ground contact detection and surface penalties
3. Modified joint limits, motor force, and frequency parameters
4. Changed link shapes (cylinders, spheres, boxes)
5. Adjusted joint positioning to prevent overlapping/floating limbs
6. Increased population size and mutation rates
7. Modified spawn position for better climbing gradient

RESULT: After 1000+ generations, fitness remained at 0. Creatures evolved as
        blobs or simple shapes that twitched in place without locomotion.

ROOT CAUSE: Starting from completely RANDOM genomes, most creatures are
            non-functional blobs. Without any creatures moving, there's no
            fitness gradient for evolution to follow.

================================================================================
CURRENT APPROACH: SEEDED EVOLUTION WITH FULL MORPHOLOGY CHANGE
================================================================================

Following PDF guidance, we now use a SEEDED approach:
1. Initial population starts with a reasonable WALKER DESIGN (not random)
2. FULL EVOLUTION is enabled - shape CAN and WILL change over generations
3. The walker is just a STARTING POINT, not a constraint

This gives evolution a head start with functional bodies, while still
allowing creatures to evolve toward optimal climbing shapes.

================================================================================
1. WALKER SEED GENOME (genome.py)
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION: Added get_fixed_walker_genome() method

Creates a reasonable walker body as SEED for initial population:
- Gene 0: Body (horizontal cylinder, compact and stable)
- Gene 1: Legs (4 legs angled downward to touch ground)

This is NOT a constraint - just a starting point. The genome WILL change
through evolution via crossover and mutation.

KEY DESIGN FEATURES:
- Body: length 0.4, radius 0.2 (compact, stable base)
- Legs: length 0.8, 4 legs via recurrence
- Leg angle: 135° pitch to point DOWNWARD toward ground
- Joint axis: X-axis rotation for forward/backward leg swing

CODE (genome.py):
    @staticmethod
    def get_fixed_walker_genome(gene_length):
        # Body gene - compact cylinder
        body_gene[1] = 0.2   # length 0.4
        body_gene[2] = 0.5   # radius 0.2

        # Leg gene - angled downward
        leg_gene[1] = 0.4    # length 0.8
        leg_gene[3] = 1.5    # 4 legs (recurrence)
        leg_gene[9] = 0.375  # 135° angle (pointing DOWN)

================================================================================
2. MOVEMENT-FIRST FITNESS (creature.py)
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION: Rewrote get_climbing_fitness() to prioritize movement

Key insight: Creatures can't climb if they can't move first.
New fitness heavily rewards ANY displacement:

    movement_reward = distance_moved * 2.0  # UNCAPPED
    progress_reward = max(0, progress) * 3.0  # Toward peak
    height_reward = max(0, final_height) * 2.0  # Vertical climb

    fitness = movement_reward + progress_reward + height_reward + 0.1

KEY CHANGES:
- Movement reward has NO CAP (more movement = higher fitness)
- Removed surface penalty (was hurting exploration)
- Base 0.1 fitness for creatures that don't crash

WHY: Creates a fitness gradient even for random motor patterns. Any creature
     that moves scores higher than stationary ones.

================================================================================
3. SEEDED EVOLUTION GA LOOP (test_ga_mountain.py)
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION: Genetic algorithm with seeded initial population

KEY FEATURES:
1. Initial population uses walker seed (reasonable starting point)
2. FULL crossover - body structure CAN mix between parents
3. FULL mutation - all genes can mutate, shape WILL change
4. Structural mutations enabled - complexity can increase/decrease

GENETIC OPERATORS:
    # Full crossover - allows body mixing
    dna = genome.Genome.crossover(p1.dna, p2.dna)

    # Full mutation - shape evolves
    dna = genome.Genome.point_mutate(dna, rate=0.25, amount=0.4)

    # Structural mutations - complexity changes
    dna = genome.Genome.shrink_mutate(dna, rate=0.05)
    dna = genome.Genome.grow_mutate(dna, rate=0.1)

WHY: The walker seed gives evolution a HEAD START with functional bodies.
     Full mutation/crossover allows creatures to EVOLVE toward optimal
     climbing shapes. Shape WILL change over generations.

================================================================================
4. SPAWN POSITION (simulation.py)
================================================================================

Creatures spawn at x=1.5 on the mountain slope (steeper gradient).
Surface height calculated using Gaussian formula to prevent crashes.

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

With seeded evolution:
1. Generation 0: All creatures start with walker body design
2. Early generations: Shapes begin to vary through mutation/crossover
3. Selection pressure: Creatures that move more are selected
4. Later generations: Shapes evolve toward optimal climbing designs
5. Final result: Evolved creatures with shapes optimized for mountain climbing

The key difference from before:
- BEFORE: Random starting shapes → most can't move → no fitness gradient
- NOW: Walker seed shapes → most CAN move → fitness gradient exists → evolution works
